class CyRasterizerBase(object):
    r"""Offscreen OpenGL rasterizer of fixed width and height.

    Parameters
    ----------

    width : `int`
        The width of the rasterize target
    height : `int`
        The height of the rasterize target
    verbose : `bool`, optional
        If ``True``, print information about setting up the rendering buffer.
        Error information is always printed.

    Notes
    -----
    For a given vertex v = (x, y, z, 1), it's position in image space
    v' = (s, t) is calculated from

    v' = P * V * M * v

    where:

    M is the model matrix
    V is the view matrix (view the world from the position of the camera)
    P is the projection matrix (usually an orthographic or perspective
    matrix)

    All matrices are 4x4 floats, as in OpenGL all points are treated as
    homogeneous.

    Note that this is the raw code written in the shader. The usual
    pipeline of OpenGL applies - perspective division is performed to
    form a clip space, and z-buffering is used to mask pixels
    appropriately.

    Texture information in the form of a texture map and normalized
    per-vertex texture coordinates) are used to source colour values.

    An arbitrary float 3-vector (f3v) can also be set on each vertex.
    This value is passed through the same pipeline and interpolated but
    note that the MATRICES ABOVE ARE NOT APPLIED TO THIS DATA.

    This can be useful for example for passing through the shape
    information of an object into the rendered image domain.
    Note that because of the above statement, the shape information
    rendered would be in the objects original space, not in camera space
    (i.e. the z value will not correlate to a depth buffer).
